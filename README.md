# bf-cc

A brainfuck interpreter and run-time compiler written in C++ for Linux/x86-64.

The input program is translated into a minimalistic IR, optimized, and then
either interpreted, or compiled to x86-64 machine code and the executed.  The
generated machine code uses the
[Linux syscall API](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.17/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl)
to perform the required I/O operations and is therefore not portable in any
way.  The optimizer is capable of performing some very basic optimizations and
could be enhanced further.

The runtime compiler uses simple, hard-coded instruction templates for each
OpCode of the IR.
